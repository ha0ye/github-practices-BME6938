## Description

Data science does not stop once you have completed an analysis and
produced a publication or poster. Share your work in a FAIR (findable,
accessible, interoperable, reusable) manner is crucial for researchers
who wish to have an impact. This lesson reviews the essential concepts
of Git and Github, the de facto tools for version control, and their
benefits for data science projects.

NO previous experience with git is required.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

  - explain the benefits of version control for coding projects
  - understand essential features of working in git and github
      - commits as project snapshots
      - branches as ways to experiment
      - merging and resolving merge conflicts
      - remotes and clones
      - collaboration workflow
  - identify resources for further learning
