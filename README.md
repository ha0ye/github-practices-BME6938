## Description

Git and GitHub are widely used tools for software version control, but
they can also be highly effective for organizing Data Science Research
Projects. This workshop will review essential concepts and commands for
using Git and GitHub in a research project setting, including both solo
and collaborative workflows.

NO previous experience with git is required, but familiarity with using
Git and GitHub will be very helpful!

## Prerequisites

This lesson assumes you:

- are proficient in programming and data analysis
- are familiar with command-line interfaces (e.g.Â unix shell)
- have a GitHub account
- have Git installed and set up on your personal computer

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

- understand essential features of working in git and github
  - commits as project snapshots
  - branches as ways to experiment
  - remotes and clones
  - collaboration workflow
- identify resources for further learning
