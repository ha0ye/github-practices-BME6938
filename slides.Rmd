You have a published data analysis.

### .center[ðŸŽ‰ Congrats! ðŸŽ‰]

What happens next?

--

* Can **I** apply the code to **new** data?
* Can **I** apply **my method** to your data?
* **Where** do you store older versions / figures that didn't make it into the paper?
* How does someone contribute to the project?

# Preliminaties

This lesson assumes you:
`r gsub("\n ", "\n", desc::desc_get("prerequisites"))`

--

**NO** previous experience with Git or GitHub is required!

---
# Learning Objectives

1 hour is insufficient to teach you how to use Git and GitHub in a data analysis workflow.

--

1 hour **is** sufficient to explain why Git and GitHub are useful in a data analysis workflow.

---
This lesson teaches you to:

`r gsub("\n ", "\n", desc::desc_get("learningOutcomes"))`

# Basic Concepts

---

# Version Control

**Version Control**: tools/systems to manage changes to files

--
## You are probably already using version control!

* MS Word has "track changes"
* Dropbox / Google Drive can revert versions

---

# Why Learn Git & GitHub

Git & GitHub are version control for **projects**.

You can:
* restore project states involving changes to multiple files.
* track *who* made *what* changes and *why*
* handle changes in any file format
* manage work from large distributed teams

---

# Example scenarios

* You change a histogram to a bar plot, and then you want to change it back.
* Your collaborator makes edits while traveling, and you need to combine their changes with changes you made in the meantime.
* You want to experiment with a different dataset / analysis / narrative without duplicating everything.

---

# Git and GitHub

--

## (not the same thing!)

---

# Git

* software and version control system
* notoriously unfriendly
  - unintuitive command names
  - obscure error messages

---

# GitHub

* a cloud platform that hosts Git repos
* unlimited *public* and *private* repos
* size limits:
  - 1 GB for each repo
  - 100 MB for individual files
* [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/pack) has some benefits
  - one code for a free t-shirt from https://github.myshopify.com/ to be given away to a random attendee
