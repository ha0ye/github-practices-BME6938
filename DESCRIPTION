Description: Data science does not stop once you have completed an analysis and produced a publication or poster. Share your work in a FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) manner is crucial for researchers who wish to have an impact. This lesson reviews the essential concepts of Git and Github, the de facto tools for version control, and their benefits for data science projects.
