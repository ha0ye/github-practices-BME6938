## Description

`r lesson_description`

## Prerequisites
```{r, include = FALSE}
prereqs <- c("are proficient in programming and data analysis", 
             "are familiar with command-line interfaces (e.g. unix shell)", 
             "have a GitHub account", 
             "have Git installed and set up on your personal computer")
prereqs_text <- paste0("* ", prereqs, collapse = "\n")
desc::desc_set("prerequisites", prereqs_text)

```

This lesson assumes you:

`r prereqs_text`

## Learning Outcomes

```{r, include = FALSE}
learning_outcomes <- c("understand essential features of working in git and github
  - commits as project snapshots
  - branches as ways to experiment
  - remotes and clones
  - collaboration workflow", 
  "identify resources for further learning")
outcomes_text <- paste0("* ", learning_outcomes, collapse = "\n")
desc::desc_set("learningOutcomes", outcomes_text)
```

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

`r outcomes_text`
