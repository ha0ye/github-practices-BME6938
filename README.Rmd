Share your work in a FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) manner is crucial for researchers who wish to have an impact.

NO previous experience with git is required."

## Description

`r lesson_description`

## Prerequisites
```{r, include = FALSE}
prereqs <- c("are proficient in programming and data analysis")
prereqs_text <- paste0("* ", prereqs, collapse = "\n")
desc::desc_set("prerequisites", prereqs_text)

```

This lesson assumes you:

`r prereqs_text`

## Learning Outcomes

```{r, include = FALSE}
learning_outcomes <- c("explain the benefits of version control for coding projects",
                       "understand essential features of working in git and github
  - commits as project snapshots
  - branches as ways to experiment
  - remotes and clones
  - collaboration workflow", 
  "identify resources for further learning")
outcomes_text <- paste0("* ", learning_outcomes, collapse = "\n")
desc::desc_set("learningOutcomes", outcomes_text)
```

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

`r outcomes_text`
